     <h2>David C. Griffiths</h2>
     <p>I am David, an aspiring computer scientist. I enjoy watching movies and learning about new things from a wide variety of fields. 
     <br>I am interested in Web Development because ever since highschool I have been fascinated with the behind the scenes workings 
     <br>of a website. I want to look at a webpage and understand how and why it does what it does.
